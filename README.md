## üß† Algorithm Explanation

### What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**
   - Set the distance to the start node as 0
   - Set all other distances to infinity
   - Mark all nodes as unvisited
   - Set start node as current

2. **Main Loop**
   - For the current node, examine all unvisited neighbors
   - Calculate tentative distances through the current node
   - If a calculated distance is less than the known distance, update it
   - Mark the current node as visited
   - Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance as the new current node

3. **Termination**
   - Algorithm terminates when the destination is reached
   - Or when all reachable nodes have been visited

4. **Path Reconstruction**
   - Backtrack from destination to source using recorded predecessors
   - This gives the shortest path

### Time Complexity

- **With Min-Priority Queue**: O((V + E) log V)
- **With Array**: O(V¬≤)

Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

### Space Complexity

- **O(V)**: For storing distances and visited nodes

### Visualization Benefits

This implementation visualizes:
- **Node exploration** (which nodes are being examined)
- **Distance updates** (when shorter paths are found)
- **Priority queue operations** (which node is selected next)
- **Path reconstruction** (final shortest path)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and Canvas API for rendering
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox/Grid, animations, and transitions
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Algorithm implementation and DOM manipulation

### Libraries & Frameworks
- **[GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/)**: Professional-grade animation library for smooth, performant transitions

### Development Tools
- **Git**: Version control
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting and deployment

### Key JavaScript Features Used
- Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Event listeners and handlers
- Canvas API for graphics rendering
- Promise-based animations

## üîß How It Works

### Graph Representation

The graph is represented using an adjacency list:

```javascript
graph = {
  'A': [{'node': 'B', 'weight': 4}, {'node': 'C', 'weight': 2}],
  'B': [{'node': 'A', 'weight': 4}, {'node': 'D', 'weight': 5}],
  // ...
}
```

### Algorithm Implementation

The core algorithm uses:
1. **Priority Queue**: To efficiently select the node with minimum distance
2. **Distance Array**: Tracks shortest known distance to each node
3. **Predecessor Array**: Records path for reconstruction
4. **Visited Set**: Prevents re-processing of nodes

### Visualization Pipeline

1. **Event Detection**: User interactions trigger graph modifications
2. **State Update**: Graph data structure is updated
3. **Rendering**: Canvas is redrawn to reflect changes
4. **Animation**: GSAP animates transitions between states
5. **Algorithm Execution**: Step-by-step with visual feedback

## üé® Customization

### Modifying Colors

Edit `style.css` to change the color scheme:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #4CAF50;
  --secondary-color: #2196F3;
  --visited-color: #FFC107;
  --path-color: #F44336;
}
```

### Adjusting Animation Speed

In `script.js`, modify the animation duration:

```javascript
const ANIMATION_SPEED = 500; // milliseconds
```

### Changing Graph Styles

Customize node and edge appearance in `script.js`:

```javascript
const NODE_RADIUS = 20;
const EDGE_WIDTH = 2;
const NODE_COLOR = '#4CAF50';
```

## üåê Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 90+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Edge 90+
- ‚úÖ Opera 76+

**Note**: Requires a modern browser with ES6+ support and Canvas API.
